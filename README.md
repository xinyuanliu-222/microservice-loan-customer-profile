# Customer Profile Managment System
This is POC project of **Customer Profile Managment System**. It is a web based appication using **Microservice** architecture with **Spring Boot, Spring Cloud and JMS**. Users can sumbit, manage, check their profile (personal information) through this web system.
This project provide the backend functionality of this system. There are 4 serbices created for accomplish this functionality. They are **_Netflix Eureka Service, API Gateway, Customer Service, Customer Profile Service._**

## Netflix Eureka Service
This service (**service-discovery**) is used to discover and register other services. The annotation:
```
@EnableEurekaServer
```

## Customer Service
This **customer-service** is a **RESTful** web service using **Jersey (JAX-RS)** implementation. This REST API perfomrs CRUD operation on the customer resource to retrieve and return data from database. Users can update and create their own information through **PUT** and **POST** methods and manager or employee can search specified customer based on customer id using **GET** method. This service connected to the **MongoDB** database using Spring Data for persisting the customer data - the personal information of user. Relational annotations:
```
@Component
@Path //specify the relative path of class and methods
@GET
@PUT
@POST
@DELETE
@Produce //states the HTTP response generated by web service
@Consume //states the HTTP request type
```

In order to access the JAX-RS resource from Spring Boot Application, this resource should be registered as **Jersey resource**.
```
@Component
@ApplicationPath("api")
public class JerseyConfig extends ResourceConfig {

	public JerseyConfig() {
		registerResources();
		registerProviders();
	}
	
	private void registerResources() {
		register(CustomerResource.class);
	}
	
	private void registerProviders() {
		register(ObjectMapperContextResolver.class);
        	register(ConstraintViolationExceptionMapper.class);
        	register(GenericExceptionMapper.class);
        	register(JsonMappingExceptionMapper.class, 1);
        	register(JsonParseExceptionMapper.class, 1);
	}
}
```

Register for Eureka Server:
```
@EnableDiscoveryClient //I used
```
Or
```
@EnableEurekaClient
```

## Customer Profile Server
This **customer-profile-server** is also a **RESTful** web service which has same implementation as customer-service. It connected to the **MongoDB** database using Spring Data for persisting customer profile data including profile Id, customer and created date. The customer data are transformed from customer service using Spring Cloud Stream-**Rabbit MQ**, which is a message broker between these 2 services for communication.

Considering the highly demanding of customer data, I configured and enable a data **caching** for customer data to improve application performance. Thus, customer data can be read from cache instead from database which is faster. But cache has a limited memory storage, I **evict** the expired customer data which are not frequently used from cache when the cache is full. Related annotations:
```
@EnableCaching
@CacheEvict(cacheNames = CachingConfiguration.CUSTOMER_CACHE, key="#customer.id")
```

## API Gateway
It consist of **Netflix Zuul Proxy** and **Spring Security JWT**. It works as a single point of interaction for different operations. Spring Security which handles the authentication and authorization at the web request level. It uses JWT for authentication by verifying userâ€™s credentials and generate access token. The Zuul proxy will routing the client business request by communicating to relevant Microservice endpoints.
